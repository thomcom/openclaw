# Project State: AgentiConsciousness

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Identity persistence - core pair holds identity even if outer layers die
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Multi-Gateway Infrastructure

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Multi-Gateway Infrastructure**
- Status: ○ Not started
- Goal: Run 5 separate gateway processes with isolated state
- Plans: 0/3 complete

## Progress Summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Multi-Gateway Infrastructure | ○ Not started |
